What is the Mantid workspace?
=============================

If you are familiar with older versions of Mantid you will be used to the user interface MantidPlot. MantidPlot was built
on Qt4 but as Qt4 is no longer being supported the Mantid Workbench was made using Matplotlib for it plotting functionality.
Currently the Mantid Workbench does not have all the functionality of MantidPlot but once it does Workbench will fully
replace MantidPlot.
